Key Points
-
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and improved sequence analysis methods have markedly increased the rate of identification of genes that cause rare genetic diseases; as many as 3,500 genes might be discovered over the next decade and added to the 'atlas' of human rare diseases, vastly increasing our current state of knowledge.
-
The identification of these genes will make molecular diagnoses possible for patients with rare diseases and their families, allowing both invasive diagnostic investigations and ineffectual treatments to cease; this will also bring clearer prognoses, improved disease management, precise reproductive counselling and, for some, the prospect of effective therapies.
-
NGS-based rare-disease diagnosis will rapidly make the transition into clinical service, representing a valuable case study in the integration of this revolutionary technology for most other realms of medicine.
-
Efficient identification of the remaining rare-disease-causing genes will require an unprecedented level of cooperation and collaboration, as well as the infrastructure and informatic tools to share deep phenotypic data and genetic variation data on a large scale.
-
Molecular insight into the rapidly increasing number of rare diseases being discovered will bring both new therapeutic opportunities and challenges, the latter of which will require the rethinking of the funding and practice of rare-disease translational research. Creative drug discovery approaches configured to rely, as much as possible, on low-cost generalizable approaches will be needed.
Abstract
Work over the past 25 years has resulted in the identification of genes responsible for ~50% of the estimated 7,000 rare monogenic diseases, and it is predicted that most of the remaining disease-causing genes will be identified by the year 2020, and probably sooner. This marked acceleration is the result of dramatic improvements in DNA-sequencing technologies and the associated analyses. We examine the rapid maturation of rare-disease genetic analysis and successful strategies for gene identification. We highlight the impact of discovering rare-disease-causing genes, from clinical diagnostics to insights gained into biological mechanisms and common diseases. Last, we explore the increasing therapeutic opportunities and challenges that the resulting expansion of the 'atlas' of human genetic pathology will bring.
