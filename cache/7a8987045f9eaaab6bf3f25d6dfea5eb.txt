As of 2002, the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had approved Neurontin, a drug developed by the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, for two uses, the treatment of epilepsy and pain related to shingles. A staggering ninety-four percent of Neurontin prescriptions in the prior five years, however, were for other (non-FDA) approved uses. These other uses effectively tripled Medicaid’s costs for the drug between 1998 and 2003. Insurance companies covered the off-label uses because they appeared in the Drugdex compendium, a federally authorized listing of drugs that includes evidence regarding the drug’s effectiveness, clinical indications, and proper dosing. Drugdex included an additional forty-eight uses for Neurontin, ranging from bipolar disorder to the hiccups. Two other federally approved compendia existed at that time; one listed seven uses for Neurontin while the other listed only one.

244 While possible that inclusions for a use in multiple compendia resulted from a particularly aggressive or persistent fraudulent marketing scheme, it is more likely that the inclusion is valid because it underwent the review process in different compendia. In theory, where one compendium's conflicts of interest policy or review guidelines have a gap, another compendium's policy should compensate.
