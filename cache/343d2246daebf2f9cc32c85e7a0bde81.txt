Open Access is defined by Wikipedia as “free, immediate, permanent, full-text, online access, for any user, web-wide, to digital scientific and scholarly material, primarily research articles published in peer-reviewed journals. OA means that any individual user, anywhere, who has access to the Internet, may link, read, download, store, print-off, use, and datamine the digital content of that article. An OA article usually has limited copyright and licensing restrictions.” Wikipedia entry on Open Access, available at
