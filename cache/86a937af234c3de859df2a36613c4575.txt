Associations Between Integration and Patient Experience in Hospital-Based Health Systems: An Exploration of Horizontal and Vertical Forms of Integration
Abstract
Goal: The U.S. hospital sector is experiencing record levels of integration, with more than half of U.S. physicians and nearly three quarters of all hospitals affiliated with one of slightly more than 630 health systems. However, there is growing evidence to suggest that health system integration is associated with more expensive and lower quality care. The goal of this research is to explore the associations between forms of health system integration and hospital patient experience scores.
Methods: A cross-section of data for the year 2019 was assembled and analyzed from the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) patient experience survey. Data from the Compendium of US Health Systems, published by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey were used to obtain independent variables and hospital-level covariates. A series of multivariable regressions was used to explore the associations between forms of health system integration and hospital patient experience scores across three domains: overall impression of the hospital; experiences with staff; and the hospital environment. Forms of both horizontal integration (i.e., number of hospitals owned by hospital-based health systems) and vertical integration (i.e., physician-hospital integration, nursing home ownership, accountable care organization [ACO] participation, group purchasing, contract management, offering insurance products, and investor ownership) were explored.
Principal findings: Although horizontal integration was not associated with any meaningful differences in patient experience scores, health systems with physician-hospital integration were associated with overall impression scores that were 2 percentage points higher than systems without physician integration. Similarly, contract management and membership in a group purchasing organization were associated with overall impression and environment scores that were 2 to 3 percentage points higher than hospitals that did not engage in those forms of integration. By contrast, investor ownership was associated with a 5% lower score for overall patient experience compared with other forms of ownership.
Practical applications: The findings of this study suggest that hospitals in more vertically integrated systems may have higher patient experience scores than independent hospitals and those that belong exclusively to horizontally integrated systems. Thus, there are elements of vertical integration that could benefit patients and be worth pursuing. Conversely, higher degrees of horizontal integration in the form of multihospital ownership may not be of any benefit to patients and should be pursued with caution.
