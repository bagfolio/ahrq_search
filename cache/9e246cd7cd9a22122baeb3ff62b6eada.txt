Abstract
High value health and healthcare data are available from both the U.S. Federal Government and the private sector. Advancements in technology and networking capabilities, as well as the rise in wearable devices and consumer health care applications, have led to a considerable increase in the volume and variety of these data. While very large databases are being combined within electronic health records systems (EHRs), information reflecting nursing and potentially other relevant interprofessional notes is still to be integrated. Numerous federal initiatives are ongoing to improve access to and use of big data, and enhance and develop new analytical tools to maximize and accelerate the integration of big data and data science into biomedical research. Nurse practitioners and researchers have the opportunity to use big data to support clinical decisions, increase understanding of patient self-reported data, and expand the emerging research field of symptoms management to ultimately contribute to elimination of health and health care disparities and promote health equity.

12.1.1 12.1.1 Introduction
To revolutionize knowledge discovery, nurse leaders are recognizing the significance of standardizing clinical practice and big data is leading the way in sharable and comparable data to achieve better health outcomes (Delaney et al. 2015). The Clinical Practice Model (CPM) work began in 1983 by visionary nurse leader and healthcare futurist Bonnie Wesorick in Grand Rapids, MI. This case study shares the evolution of the CPM Framework and Models, which have provided a strong foundation for today’s call to promote standardization, interoperability and contribution to the science of big data. The authors, all active participants in the University of Minnesota Big Data Science Nursing Knowledge Initiative, describe the attributes and value of implementing a culture and professional practice framework with a structured data model to accelerate big data capacity. The CPM Consortium has engaged over 400 organizations that have implemented the CPM Framework over time and have made significant contributions to the design, validation and expansion of all elements of the framework and models, including preparation for a data-driven, learning healthcare system. Lessons learned from the consortium will be shared including barriers to adoption of the standardized data as well as challenges in accessing the documented data for outcome and research purposes.
12.1.2 12.1.2 A Framework Approach
The CPM Framework (Fig.
[12.1.1](#Fig1)) has evolved over three decades and was designed to achieve the vision of sustainable culture and practice transformation and to address the challenges that all clinical settings encounter in achieving that vision. Benefits associated with using a framework driven approach are that it is (a) scalable, (b) data driven, and (c) can change as healthcare changes. It is also grounded in core beliefs, theories and principles and integrates the theoretical components of informatics with evidence-based practice within an overarching framework that is intentionally designed to support the patient, family, community, and caregivers to advance the culture and practice of care (Elsevier, CPM Resource Center 2011).
Each model is interrelated, action-oriented, outcome producing, replicable, evidence-based and technology-enabled to move healthcare organizations into a capacity-building mindset and into action (Wesorick and Doebbeling 2011; Christopherson et al. 2015). While each model plays a role in supporting sharable and comparable data, for the purpose of this case study, a detailed view of the Health Informatics Model will be provided followed by the Applied Evidence-Based Practice Model as both of these models enable the mapping to standardized clinical terminologies and big data science.
The Health Informatics Model, organized within a relational data base management system, is expressed in three different tiers: (1) Data Tier (physical layer) in which the content resides in a Structure Query Language (SQL) database where it is structured, mapped, and SQL-tagged to support the professional processes of care as well as national reference terminologies such as LOINC and SNOMED-CT; (2) Logic Tier (design layer), in which the rigorous content authorship process as described in the Applied Evidence-based Practice Model is abstracted to support principles of intentionally designed automation, provide context in the clinicians workflow and allow updating of content and change management as an ongoing process; and (3) Presentation Tier (end-user view at point of care) in which the standardized evidence-based content is expressed within any electronic health record (EHR) to support professional practice and documentation of services rendered. The Health Information Model includes documentation for six professional processes of care including capturing the patient story, planning care, providing care and education, evaluating progress toward goals, and providing professional exchange of patient information. The Health Information Model has been key to standardizing practice on the front end, creating practice and content interoperability as well as expediting the mapping to common terminologies and standards on the back end. This approach is critical to exchanging data and creating big data sets generated by interprofessional teams who care for patients and families across the care continuum.
The Applied Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) Model is an action-oriented model that includes over 400 evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) that are rigorously researched, graded and leveled to objectively identify the guideline elements that support the professional scopes of practice and processes of care across health professions. The CPGs provide the foundation for the plan of care and clinical documentation by leveraging structured notes, templates and flowsheets within the EHR, and consequently generate data supportive of big data science. The Applied EBP Model also supports content that provides standardized assessments and interventions, including research-based assessment scales (>60) that are standardized for multiple patient populations. The significance of having sustainable EBP environments to improve hospital performance metrics was recently identifiedby Melnyk et al. (2016). This calls for chief nurse executives to look at their current investment and integration of EBP into the EHR as one of the critical enablers of a sustainable EBP environment as well as big data research contributing to the body of evidence (knowledge discovery).
The Health Information Model and the Applied Evidence-Based Practice Model provide the capability to intentionally design automation via standardized clinical documentation and embedded clinical decision support (CDS) from the CPGs. This has enabled the ability to code standard assessment data from assessment scales and defined assessment parameters as well as the CPG content itself that is documented against in the EHR. The interrelated and action-oriented nature of these two models supports practice interoperability and content interoperability. Practice interoperability assures the same level of professional practice across all clinical settings and patient information exchange via a common culture and professional practice framework. Content interoperability assures consistency of content and associated coded-data that is exchanged accurately and effectively within and across various practice platforms.
12.1.2.1 12.1.2.1 Coding CPM Framework and Models to Standardized Clinical Terminologies
Always futuristic and with strong desire to advance professional practice, the first coding of CPM content to standardized terminology was in the late 1990s immediately following the first intentional design and implementation of CPM in an EHR. Coding was completed with standard nursing language and presented by Troseth and Hanson (1999) at the Second Conference on Nursing Diagnoses, Interventions and Outcomes (NANDA/NIC/NOC) Conference as an important concept worth exploring. Despite positive feedback from conference participants and standard experts, adoption proved to be difficult in the healthcare environment at the time due to factors such as lack of EHR vendor ability to organize and report, lack of healthcare organizations’ ability to implement and report outcomes, and the beginning advancement of interdisciplinary approaches to care and documentation.
A decade later the HITECH Act of 2009 was enacted to tackle commercial, economic and technical barriers and to enhance information exchange. With its passage another window opened to realize the benefits of coding the CPM Framework documentation components to standardized clinical terminology. In addition, the passage of the Accountable Care Act (ACA) and the accepted terminologies of LOINC and SNOMED-CT provided the direction required to prioritize a coding roadmap that also aligned with the priorities of national nursing organizations, such as the American Nursing Association (ANA) and American Academy of Nursing (AAN).
12.1.2.2 12.1.2.2 Within Defined Limits (WDL) Assessments Mapped to Standardized Terminology
Patient assessments can vary nurse to nurse unless there are clearly defined assessment parameters. Assessing to specific parameters provides uniformity in professional assessment standards. This assures the standardization of a baseline assessment and decreases in variability of care. Within Defined Limits (WDL) provides a high level of assessment consistency between clinicians, and is legally sound because the definitions are predefined and clarify assessment expectations. It also improves usability and efficiency resulting in decreased documentation time. The CPM Consortium has been utilizing WDLs since the early 1980s and today it is used in over 400 healthcare settings. In 2013, the CPM Consortium underwent the latest review/revision via Collaborative Learning Communities (CLCs) from multiple sites and disciplines using current evidence and clinical expertise for each patient population. As part of the Nursing Knowledge Big Data Science Initiative, we advocated for, and have contributed to the Nursing Big Data Workgroup on Encoding nursing assessments using LOINC and SNOMED CT. An example of a CPM WDL for cardiac assessment coded to LOINC and SNOMED-CT (Fig.
[12.1.2](#Fig2)) shows the clinical impression (WDL parameters) and the associated codes.
12.1.2.3 12.1.2.3 CPM Clinical Practice Guidelines Mapped to Standardized Terminology
Each CPG supports scope of practice and reveals the value of nursing practice as part of the clinical documentation. The tool is designed to support the following professional processes of care: Care Planning, Assessment, and Intervention and Goal/Outcome Measurement. Pressure Ulcer—Risk For is provided as an example (Fig.
[12.1.3](#Fig3)) to show how the problem, outcomes and interventions can be coded to associated standardized terminologies using SNOMED-CT.
12.1.3 12.1.3 CPG Pressure Ulcer-Risk For- Example
It is important to note that the coded data elements are captured in the rows of clinical documentation behind the scenes from the clinician at the point of care as a result of the activation of the CPG on the Plan of Care. The CPM CPGs that address the priority chronic disease conditions (Heart Failure, Diabetes, etc.) across the continuum provide the foundation for big data comparative analysis for population health management along with other future coded assessment data such as Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health (SBDH) on the CPM Patient Profile.
12.1.4 12.1.4 The Challenges of Utilizing and Sharing Big Data
Many lessons have been learned over the past two decades of leveraging technology to advance professional practice and point-of-care transformation. There are three primary barriers to shift to a future state of adoption of standardized evidence-based clinical practice and big data analytics for knowledge discovery as a normative process:
-
1.
Customization of Clinical Content Compromises Data Harmonization. One of the biggest challenges in providing standardized evidence-based clinical content is the tendency for organizations to review and change the data, frequently going back to “this is the way we have always charted this here”. This pattern of variances in clinical documentation inhibits data collection despite having an initial common assessment tool and EHR vendor. The implication of customization for use of secondary data for research is described in Bowles et al. (2013) study across multi-hospital sites. As evidence-based clinical content sets grow and the relevance of “standardization of care” based on evidence is more understood, organizations are realizing the value of “adopting vs. customizing”. CPM has a process in place that welcomes suggested changes from CPM Consortium Sites along with their rationale based on the evidence. Most importantly, the CPM Transformation Services team is composed of experienced clinicians grounded in the CPM Framework and Models methodologies. They are able to provide the “why” behind the content design and help to educate and guide the transformational process of the intentionally designed automation. This helps to prevent the kinds of needless customization that impact practice interoperability and data harmonization.
-
2.
Slow Uptake of Latest Version of Clinical Content and Workflow Enhancements (Version Control). Another barrier to success is that healthcare organizations get behind in upgrading to the latest version of their CPM clinical content. Elsevier CPM is updated twice annually and there are strategies in place to efficiently deliver the latest updated content to healthcare organizations. Sometimes organizations get behind due to competing priorities, more focus on the EHR implementation/software upgrades and roll-outs and/or lack of resources to assist with the content upgrade process. This is an area that has seen much improvement. More and more, organizations are realizing the value of expending the necessary resources to upgrade to the latest versions after experiencing the ramifications of getting behind on versions of clinical content (including the benefit of coding to standardized clinical terminologies).
-
3.
Lack of Data Extraction and Analytic Skills. Last, not having more attention, tools and skill sets to extract and analyze data at the local and enterprise levels has impacted the realized benefits of standardized evidence-based clinical content and coded terminologies. There needs to be more focus on the technical ability and skill sets to pull data out of the EHRs, such as report writing and data analysis, in order to conduct research on continuous data use and publish big data studies. This skill set will be key for nurses to develop and/or advocate for in order to make contributions to big data science.
12.1.5 12.1.5 Conclusion
The call and attention on big data science from nursing leadership could not be more timely and important. Collaboration on driving big data science is significant work beyond nursing as it will also set the pace for interprofessional education and practice priorities. We believe a framework approach is critical to transform the complex health system and that the knowledge from big data will further add to the evolution of the CPM Framework and Models as well as better health outcomes.
