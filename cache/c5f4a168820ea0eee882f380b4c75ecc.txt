Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic remains a global health crisis, yet, the immunopathological mechanisms driving the development of severe disease remain poorly defined. Here, we utilize a rhesus macaque (RM) model of SARS-CoV-2 infection to delineate perturbations in the innate immune system during acute infection using an integrated systems analysis. We found that SARS-CoV-2 initiated a rapid infiltration (two days post infection) of plasmacytoid dendritic cells into the lower airway, commensurate with IFNA production, natural killer cell activation, and induction of interferon-stimulated genes. At this early interval, we also observed a significant increase of blood CD14-CD16+ monocytes. To dissect the contribution of lung myeloid subsets to airway inflammation, we generated a novel compendium of RM-specific lung macrophage gene expression using a combination of sc-RNA-Seq data and bulk RNA-Seq of purified populations under steady state conditions. Using these tools, we generated a longitudinal sc-RNA-seq dataset of airway cells in SARS-CoV-2-infected RMs. We identified that SARS-CoV-2 infection elicited a rapid recruitment of two subsets of macrophages into the airway: a C206+MRC1-population resembling murine interstitial macrophages, and a TREM2+ population consistent with CCR2+ infiltrating monocytes, into the alveolar space. These subsets were the predominant source of inflammatory cytokines, accounting for ~75% of IL6 and TNF production, and >90% of IL10 production, whereas the contribution of CD206+MRC+ alveolar macrophages was significantly lower. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected RMs with baricitinib (Olumiant Â® ), a novel JAK1/2 inhibitor that recently received Emergency Use Authorization for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, was remarkably effective in eliminating the influx of infiltrating, non-alveolar macrophages in the alveolar space, with a concomitant reduction of inflammatory cytokines. This study has delineated the major subsets of lung macrophages driving inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production within the alveolar space during SARS-CoV-2 infection.
One sentence summary: Multi-omic analyses of hyperacute SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus macaques identified two population of infiltrating macrophages, as the primary orchestrators of inflammation in the lower airway that can be successfully treated with baricitinib.
