Abstract
The articles in this monograph illustrate the progress and successes of comprehensive cancer control (CCC) since our 2005 publication. The strides made in CCC demonstrate the energy and commitment of this nationwide movement to reduce the burden of cancer for all people. The purpose of this conclusion paper is to discuss the future of CCC, which promises a new emphasis on policy, primary prevention, public health, evidence-based interventions, and global health supported by advanced communication tools.
