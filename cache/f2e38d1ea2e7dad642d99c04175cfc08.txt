In 2009, health care expenditures in the United States totaled $2.5 trillion and accounted for almost eighteen percent of the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Rising health care costs are an increasing concern in the national health care industry and in government policy reform. When estimates show that thirty percent of health care is unnecessary, improving quality and efficiency of health care could eliminate a significant amount of excessive spending.
Prescription drugs contributed to ten percent of national health expenditures in 2009, comprising about $250 billion. And while the rate of growth for overall health care spending declined as a result of the recent recession, “the number of prescription drugs dispensed rebounded to prerecession rate of growth.” Estimates show that off-label drug use comprises between twenty and sixty percent of U.S. prescriptions. This could be a troubling percentage considering that off-label use carries an increased risk of harm or ineffectiveness.

9 Id. § 321(p)(1). The FDA drug approval process has received much criticism for its lengthiness. Before a drug maker can submit an Investigational New Drug Application (IND), it must conduct investigations of the drug’s effect on animals to determine if it is safe for human clinical trials. This may take as long as three and a half years. After approval of the IND, the drug must undergo three phases of clinical trials. Phase I trials test toxicity of the drug on humans to determine if it is safe, and takes six to twelve months to complete. Phase II trials test the therapeutic effectiveness on humans suffering from the condition, and takes eighteen months to two years to complete. Phase III consists of clinical trials to further develop effectiveness data, and can last for an average of three years. After completion of the three phases, the drug maker can submit a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA, which the agency approves within 180 days.

Although Sorrel differs in that it involves the treatment of personal patient data, a holding that such restrictions violate the First Amendment increase the likelihood that an Allergan-like constitutional challenge to the off-label marketing ban would be successful.

Many are managed by families of individuals who have suffered or died from serious diseases. Others are run commercially or by professional medical societies.” Id. at 8. While these voluntary organizations may be either for- or non-profit, Epstein describes them as “typically nonprofit organizations that serve the same basic intermediation function in virtually all markets: to collect, digest, and interpret material for their members in areas where there is an information shortfall.

114 States requiring insurers to cover off-label drug use for cancer treatment include Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. Id. n.84.
115 S.C. Code Ann. § 38-71-275 (1976).
116 These states include Alabama, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio, and Oregon. Francis, supra note 64, at 235 n.85. For example, in Ohio, no policy “shall limit or exclude coverage on the basis that the drug has not been approved by the United States food and drug administration for the treatment of a particular indication for which the drug has been prescribed . . . .” Ohio Rev.

119 Id. (describing plaintiffs’ argument that they were entitled to reimbursement under federal Medicaid law because the drugs were listed in a congressionally approved compendia).
120 Id. The state argued that “medically accepted indication” required clinically verifiable data—i.e., two double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials. Id. This standard is equivalent to requirements for FDA approval of a supplemental use of a drug. See supra note 72 and accompanying text.
