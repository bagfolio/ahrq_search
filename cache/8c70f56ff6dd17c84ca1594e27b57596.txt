Off-Label Use of Medications: Innovative Prescribing or Risky Business?
Off-label use of medication is common and can lead to innovations in the use of medicine to treat patients in unconventional ways. However, issues of increased health care costs, decreased reimbursement, and lack of clinical data to support off-label use, are concerns of practitioners and patients alike. By using their knowledge of medications and carefully examining the existing research, pharmacists can aid prescribers in appropriate off-label medication use.
